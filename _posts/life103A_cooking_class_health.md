## Intro about Information about the Basics of Health:
- Calories: all food has calories, but we have a limit of around 2500 calories per day for good health, so use your calories efficiently
- nutrients: how healthy the food is 
## Macros:
There are three different types of macros that we need to be aware of, on how we can manage our health
- protein: used for muscel growth, and your diet should consist of 10-35% protein
- fats: healthy fats help your body produce lipids, which are fatty compounds that perform a variety of funcions in your body. Your diet should consist of 20-35% fats, but be sure to use good fats. Stay away from trans fats, if you can. 
- fiber: type of nutrients that can help your gut get healthy. Examples of high fiber foods are the leafy green vegetables that are super healthy for you. 

# Types of Vitamins:
There are many types of vitamins, 13 to be exaxct, but to save you time and confusion, here is a list of some of the most important viamins to help your body: A, B, C, D, E, and K.  They all do different tyings to help your body, but fruits, vegetables and popular meat products can help your body get those different vitamins that your body needs.

## Food Groups: 
As we learned from the food pyramid that we learned about in school growing up, there are five food groups: meats/proteins, fruit, veggies, dairy, and grains. A suggestion for having good health is to spend more time eating fruits, veggies, and meat/protein. It's okay to have some foods in the grains section, but just remember, it is important to balance a carb with a protein.  Examples of good snacks to pair together are:
- rice and beans
- fruit and a handful of nuts
- a turkey and cheese sandwich
etc
