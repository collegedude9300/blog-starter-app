## Welcome to LIFE 105: Social Skills
## The purpose of Being Social:
Humans are social in nature. This is why it's important for people to have friends growing up. Usually, neurotypical people naturally learn to socialize at a young age, but individuals with Autism, Asperger's and related special needs need a little extra guidance on how to get started with knowing the hidden curriculum, as well as learning to make friends.
## Lesson One Part 1: Basic Rules on Making Friends: How To Find Friends
### 1. Mutual Interest in Friendship:
Friendship is a two-way street. It only works when both people are interested. As a young adult, there are many places to meet new people, such as at college, work, from mutual friends, or places where your special interests are (ex: gamers in a gaming store, metal listeners at a metal concert, coffee enthusiasts at a coffee shop, etc). 
### 2.  Common Ground/ Mutual Interests:
Friendships work when people are interested in being friends, and if the other person seems nice. However, to make a lasting friendship, there needs to be common ground. What that means is someone that has things in common with you. 
### 3.  Location and Timing:
Another part of making friends is locations and timing. Here are some examples of good locations:
 - - Coffee Shops
 -  - College 
    (particularly in mutual classes, or events)
 - - Work
 - - Concerts (when it's not too noisy)
 Here are some examples of bad locations:
 - -  Library (people are trying to either read, or study)
 - -  Bars (too much peer pressure into drinking)
 - -  Streets (people may be in a hurry)
 - -  Church  (people are trying to listen to the service)
 - - Funerals (people are too emotional during this time)
- -  While we have our good locations, timing is everything too. Here are some examples of good timing and bad timing:
 ### Good Timing: 
 -  People talking in a coffee shop (wait for a pause and see if they're interested first)
 -  College during events, or at the end of class, or start of class
 -  Campus cafeteria (see rules for #1)
 -  Work (during your 15 minute break or lunch)
### Bad Timing: (for good locations)
-  Coffee shops when in line (lines move fast sometimes)
-  College during class (Professor is trying to teach)
-  Work when you're on the clock (you have to get your work done first before break/lunch)

##  Lesson 1 Part 2: Trading Information
Now that you have made a new friend, it is time to trade information. Trading information is important because that way, there is a way to get ahold of the other person. Examples of trading information: cellphone numbers, email, social media, etc. 
### How to Trade Information:
1. 1.  Go up to the person when he or she is not busy
2. 2.  Look at the person, and then when the person seems interested in talking, introduce yourself if it's the first time meeting that person
3. 3. Ask the other person about him or herself
4. 4. When the other person finishes, they will ask about you as well, but if the person doesn't, then go ahead and say something about yourself
5. 5. As soon as you find out if you and the other person have anything in common, think about things you can talk about, or activities to do together.
6. 6. Once you know each other a little better, exchange information (cellphone number, social media, etc)
### TIPS:
- TIP: Listen to what the other person's disinterests are too, so that way you can avoid scheduling those activities
- TIP: Be sure to share the conversation (i.e. let the other person talk too). Be careful not to talk too long, so that way the person has a chance to talk too


## Lesson Two: The Basics of Body Language
### Signs and Important Expressions
- - **Interested vs Not Interested:**
 - **Interested:**
 1. People's bodies are turned towards you
 2. Smile
 - Not Interested: 
 1. People's bodies are turned away from you
 2. Doesn't show a smile

## Lesson Three: Two Way Conversation
Here are the general steps and guidelines for having a two-way conversation:
1. Trade information- in this context, this means finding out if you have anything in common with the other person.
2. Use the statement, question statment rule
 1. A. Say a statement about what you want to talk about (i.e. hobbies)
 2. B. Ask a question about their special interests
 3. C. Wait for the peer to answer and then make a comment about what they said
 3. 3.  Share the conversation (don't talk too long, let the other person talk too)
 - ### TIPS:
 1. TIP: When you first meet someone, don't ask personal questions at first.
 2. TIP: Don't be an interviewer (asking question after question). Refer to rule 2.
 3. TIP: Listen to your friend
 4. TIP: Don't critisize or tease at first. People you don't know well don't know your humor yet.
 5. TIP: Be serious when you first get to know someone.
 6. TIP: Use good volume control. Not too loud or soft.
 7. TIP: Remember to use personal space. A rule of thumb is one arm length.
 8. TIP: Always make eye contact when someone is talking to you. 
## Lesson Four: Appropriate Use of Humor
Eventually after you and your friend get familiar enough and start to get to know each other a little better, you guys will start to joke around a little.
Here are some guidelines to be sure that you are using appropriate humor, and doing so correctly.
- Do not repeat jokes after you have told them
- Humor should be age appropriate: it should not be too childish, but at the same time, it cannot be innappropriate either, especially when first getting to know someone
- When first getting to know someone, avoid insult jokes
- Avoid telling racist, or religious, or politics related jokes. It can be controversial.
- Be sure to tell the joke at the right time

### Good Times:
- Parties
- get-Togethers
- events (college)

### Bad Times:
-  Coffee shops when in line (lines move fast sometimes)
-  College during class (Professor is trying to teach)
-  Work when you're on the clock (you have to get your work done first before break/lunch)
- Church
- funerals

## Lesson 7: Social Media Hidden Curriculum: Dos and Don'ts
Important DO's:
- Be sure to ask the person's permission first, before adding them on social media (i.e. Facebook, Instagram). That way they will know beforehand that you will be adding them to your page. Also, they will appreciate it more if you get their permission.
- If they say, "Maybe", "No", or say that they rarely use social media (same thing as no), then just move on.
- When on social media, when you want to message/DM someone, be sure to only send one message at a time before they repond. 
A general rule of thumb is only send up to two messages per a few days with no response.
- If someone leaves you on  seen or read, the chances are that they may be in a hurry and may be busy, but they will respond to the message soon. 
Another reason may be that they are either not interested in talking today (busy, sick, or tired), and they'll talk later, or if they are not interested at all. 
If that happens, then wait until the person messages you back before you message again. Otherwise, you will be considered rude and annoying if you send several messages at once. 
- When you don't know the person very well, try to only like one or two posts at a time. Otherwise, if you like a bunch at a time,  this will be spamming, and the other person may get uncomfortable, or annoyed and will stop talking to you. 
- Just like real life, make sure to be kind while messaging other people, and not say rude things. Unless you are close friends with the person, try not to use any cuss words, or talk about taboo topics like politics, or religion.

Important DON'Ts:
- Don't add someone without their permission. Otherwise, they will not know that you want to add them. Also, the person may not want to talk to you anymore.
- Don't send more than two messages at a time without a response. Also, if they leave you on seen or read, then don't keep messaging them. Wait until they respond back.
- Don't take it personal when someone rejects your friend request, or if they leave you on seen or read with no response. There's always another person out there to talk to.
- Just like real life, don't say rude things to people when talking to each other on social media. It will hurt their feelings.
- Unless you know the person well,or if you know the person is okay with cussing, don't cuss until you know the other person is okay with it. Also, stay away from taboo topics, until you know the person better.
