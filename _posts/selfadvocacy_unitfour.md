In our community, most adults already know how to advocate for themselves in the real world. 
However, people with Autism Spectrum Disorder may find advocating for themselves difficult, as often at tines, it does not occur to them, due to the social demands of standing their ground, and speaking up for what is right. 
## Definition of Advocacy:
- Self- Advocacy- the process in which we get our wants and needs met independedntly.
## Why It's Important:
It is important because if you want to be independent, you will need to advocate for yourself. 
Scientifically, there is a six-stage template plan to  learn how to self-advocate
## Stages:
1. Planning and Modeling- this stage will be focused on planning on how to make the self-advocacy experience successful.
You will have someone there with you to observe to see how other people advocate.
2. Facilitation- this stage will be focused on the chosen partner showing you how to self advocate, through a step by step process.
3. Partnering- independence will be increased in this stage, and you will learn to write letters of accomodation about your needs and wants that you want accommodations for.
4. Moral Support- You will be focused on doing at least most of the talking, but the partner will fade back, but you will still ask questions if you are unsure about something.
5. Lead- By then, if you are ready, you should be able to self-advocate 90% independedntly, but asking very few questions if needed.
6. Independent- You are now ready.
## Passive vs Assertive vs Aggressive
It is important to stand up for yourself, and be able to self-advocate, but at the same time, you still have to do so in a professional manner.
This is why we need to learn what the terms mean, and chose the most appropriate response.
- Passive- someone that hides, or ingores a situation and just gives in to whatever the situation is, usually just to avoid confrontation of any kind.
- Assertive- Someone that stands up for what they believe the right solution to a problem is, but does so without being hostile, or agressive.
- Agressive- Someone that gets upset and overreacts to a situation, and starts yelling, or being hostile, and saying mean words.

## Which One is Correct:
- Passive: This is not correct, because if you hide from a problem, or if you agree to what the person says, but if it's not what you want, it will
teach people to take advantage of you, which is not right. Besides, your feelings matter!
- Assertive- This is correct, because you are still able to voice your concerns and have your own opinion, but you are doing so without hurting people's feelings in a hostile manner.
- Agressive- This is not correct, because if you yell, or act hostile, then not only will you not get what you want, but the other people will be upset, and it will make things worse.
