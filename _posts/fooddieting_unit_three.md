## How to Measure your Diet: General Tips
General Rule of Thumb: Always balance between proteins and carbs: for every carbs, add some protein to it, 
to prevent your bloodsugar from spiking.  Also, be aware of any foods that say, "**fat free**", or, "**low fat**". Often, they have many added **chemicals**, or added **GMOs**.

## Food Groups:
- Vegatables: 
- **Good examples**: anything green, carrots, or corn (fresh)
- Fruit:
- **Good examples**: raspberries, strawberries, kiwi, dragon fruit, passionfruit
- Dairy:
- Use only sometimes, since most dairy products contain fats.
- **Good examples**: almond/soy/oat milk, string cheese, Greek yogurt
- Nuts, Meat, and Poultry:
- **Good examples**: almonds, cashews, walnuts, any non-red meats (or at least ones with no nitrates), salmon
- Grains:
- Use only sometimes, since most grain products contain fats and carbs.
- **Good examples**: rice, gluten free bread, quiona noodles
