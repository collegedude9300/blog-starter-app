## Cleaning Schedule and List of Chores
To make things easier, priortize the chores that you have to do, so that way you don't have to worry about doing everything in one day.  Here is a chore chart list:
- Vaccum: every other day, or every few days (about 3 times a week)
- Dusting: 1-2 times a week
- Dishes:
- Option 1: if you have a dishwasher, just rinse your dishes and put them in the dishwasher and load the dishwasher when it's full (about once a week, or week and a half)
- Option 2: If  you don't have a dishwasher, then it should be done daily.
- Kitchen Counters: daily
- Bathroom Counters: either daily, or every other day.
- Bathroom Mirrors: every other day, or if needed
- Stove: every other day, unless you are cooking a big meal, and it gets all messy, then you need to clean it directly afterwards.
- Microwave: every other day, unless you are microwaving something and it makes a mess (soups, and oatmeal especially), then clean it immediately afterwards.
- Trash: 
Throw all garbage away in a trash bin, and have a bin for every room in the house. When the bins are **full** , take the trash out. This avoids the house smelling stinky, and the trash can cause rodents and other animals to crawl in the house, and spread disease. 
If you have a dog or cat, clean  up and remove their waste daily. 
## House Safety Rules and Tips
1. If something catches on fire, call 911.
2. If a toilet gets clogged, use a plunger and press down and up over and over a few times until the toilet gets unclogged. If you think it's unclogged, flush it.  If it works, then you are done. If not, call a plumber to help fix it. It can cost a lot of money, but it's worth it if needed.
3. If something is leaking, then there are some steps to follow:
- A. Turn off the **water supply** (usually in the garage)
- B. Turn off the **electricity** (usually in the garage) to prevent getting shocked, or electrocuted
- C. Place a bucket, or container under the leak to contain all of the water. You may need a second bucket just in case.
- D. Call a **plumber** immediately. Plumbers are trained to fix leaks.
- E. Call your insurance company. They are usually there to help cover the cost of maintenence. Also, if it is a severe leak, then you can file a claim with them.

## How to do Laundry Intro: 
Basic Steps on how to do the Laundry:
1. Sort your laundry into **colors**, **darks**, and **whites**. Usually for darks and colors, you can do them together, but for lighter colors, you may need to separate them from the darks, and colors that are not as bright. 
 You can either have two or three separate hampers, or you can buy one large one that separates the darks, colors, and the whites, that have labels on it to tell the difference.
 2. When the bin or bins are full, take them to the garage, and put them in a basket. When the basket is full, then that means you will have a full load of laundry.
 3. For washing the laundry, put the clothes in the washer, and balance them , so that way, each side has an equal amount of weight. That way, when you go to start the washer, it will balance correctly and will work the right way. 
 4. Follow the below directions for colors and whites (4 A-c)
 5. Start the washing machine after you turn the dial. Make sure that you turn the dial for the appropriate section, or else you will damage and stain your clothes.
 To start the machine, put the laundry top down and it will have a button where you press it to make it start. 
 6. When the washer is finished, you will usually hear a noise letting you know that the machine is finished. When it finishes, wait until the machine is completely finished before opening it. 
 7. Before putting the clothes into the dryer, take each clothing and shake it off a little. 
 8. Open the dryer door, and put the clothes into the dryer.  Make sure that the dryer is balanced so that each side has an equal weight. This way, the dryer will balance the clothes right. Put a dryer sheet in the dryer to help your clothes soften up.
 9. Set the timer for however long it takes to finish drying all the clothes. For pants, you may need to set the timer longer to make sure all the clothes get completely dried. Rule of thumb, 20-30 minutes is enough time. 
 10. When it's finished, check the clothes to see if they have completely finished drying.
  If they are not completely dried, then set the timer longer.

## Colors:
4. Part A: For colors, pour the laundry detergent into a small measuring container. It will tell you how much to pour. 
4. Part B: When the container is full, pour it by spreading it around to make sure that there's enough for both sides. 
4. Part C: For colors, turn the dial to where you see the color section. Each machine will have a slightly different setting, but generally, for colors, you can see where it says Colors, and for whites, Whites. 
## Whites:
4. Part A: Do the same thing for 4 A-C, but for whites, you need to add a step. For whites, you need to also pour some bleach as well, so that way, it will help the whites stay their white color, and not stain. For whites, turn the dial to where it says Whites.
## Laundry Safety Tips:
### Washer:
1. Only put bleach for whites. If you put bleach for colors, then it will bleach out the color in the clothes, and get ruined. 
2. Never mix your whites and colors together, or you will stain and damage your clothes. 
3. Once you start the washer, you can't open it until it is completely finished. Otherwise, it will damage the washer. 
### Dryer:
- 1. When you are done using the dryer, make sure that you empty the filter before using the dryer again. If you don't, then the dryer will risk catching on fire.
- 2. Check your pockets before washing or drying clothes. Remove all items from your pockets from your dirty pants or shorts. You should especially remove anything that has ink, or anything that will risk staining the washer and dryer.
