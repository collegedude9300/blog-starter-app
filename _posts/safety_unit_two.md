In our community, safety is important, and it's all around us. In the role of safety, there are several components of safety that we are going to be discussing. 
## Types of Safety: 

## General Safety
## Basic Emergency Services and how to Respond to Them:
- Police: call when it's an emergency, such as when someone tries to abuse/hurt you, steal from you, or if you see a crime taking place,  and you could
call them when there's a medical emergency as well, but the most likely service to call for that is the ambulance.
- Firefighters- call when there's a fire
- Ambulance- call when there's someone hurt, or if you're hurt, or if there's anyone who's choking, or in danger.
## How to Tell if It's an Emergency vs When it's Not:
- emergencies mean life threatening things like fires, someone choking, someone hurt, or you are hurt, or someone doing danger to someone else, or any thefts
- Non emergencies include: asking officers questions about information, if a vehicle is abandoned, asking for directions, or any court date information including for tickets 
## How to Respond to a Police Officer:
- When a Police Officer pulls you over:
1. Pull over when it's safe
2. He/she will ask you for your license and registration information, so take it out (let them know first before doing it, to be safe)
3. Listen to what the officer says to you. If what you did was a minor offense (going 5 over the speed limit, or turning in the turning lane too soon), then
if you cooperate, then it will be less likely that he or she will ticket you. 
4. If you do get ticketed, then you can file a claim, if they falsely ticket you, or just pay the fine via mail, or going in person to send the money.
- When a Police Stops You: TIPS:
1. When they say, "Don't move", then they say , "Put your hands up", that means be still, but be sure to put your hands up when they say to do so.
2. When they request for your ID, let them know before grabbing it. Otherwise, they will just see it as you putting their life in danger because they may 
think you have a weapon, or something that could act as a weapon.
3. When a police questions you, you have a right to a lawyer. Saying the wrong answers will lead you to more trouble, so it's better to be safe than sorry.
4. Have a plan ready with your family beforehand, so that they can help you know your rights, especially if you are on the spectrum.
You can have a card ready to give to the officers, so that way, they will understand why your response may be delayed, or unusual to them. 
That way, the officers will know you have a Autism spectrum disorder, and not think you are under the influence of any substances.

## Housekeeping and Cleaning Safety
For maintaining a house, the two major safety categories to focus on first before doing any other types of chores are:
- Sanitation 
Picking up any pet waste, taking out any full garbage cans or bins, and making sure that the bathrooms and sinks are cleaned regularly
- fixing any safety hazards
This includes any leaks, any broken glass or any appliances, any mold, or peeling paint
- important numbers to have
 1. plumber 
 2. electrician 
 3. 911 for emergencies
 4. insurance companies
 5. your parents if you need advice

## Food Safety:

 - If you have a flat tire, follow these steps:


 - If any light appears on your car, follow these steps:
  1. Recognize a light, and see what action you should take:
    - If it's an engine light (even yellow), drive to your dealership immediately, or call them to set an appointment to get it checked out
     - If it's a maintenance light (i.e. oil change), or any other yellow light,  it's usually not URGENT, but still make an appointment as soon as possible to get maintenance done.
     - If it's a red light (regardless of the symbol), drive to your dealership immediately, or in more urgent situations, get a tow truck to get your car towed to the dealership.
     - If it's a tire light (yellow), go to a tire shop and have it checked out. Either the tire is low on air, or something was caught in, or underneath the tire.
